# Dongxiang–Chinese Translation Project

## Project Overview

The **Dongxiang–Chinese Translation Project** is an open, non-profit initiative dedicated to building high-quality bilingual resources and translation tools for **Dongxiang**, a low-resource and underrepresented language, with the goal of supporting language preservation, accessibility, and computational research.

## Background

Dongxiang (Santa) is a minority language spoken primarily in **Gansu Province, China**. Due to the scarcity of digitized corpora and linguistic resources, Dongxiang is considered a low-resource language in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). This project aims to bridge that gap by systematically constructing bilingual dictionaries, aligned sentence data, and experimental translation systems between **Dongxiang and Chinese**, while also providing a public-facing platform for cultural and linguistic dissemination.

## Key Features

- **Dongxiang ↔ Chinese bilingual translation system** supporting word-level and sentence-level translation, designed specifically for low-resource language settings;
- **Carefully curated Dongxiang–Chinese dictionary**, with systematic cleaning, normalization, and disambiguation to improve linguistic clarity and computational usability;
- **NLP-oriented dataset design**, enabling downstream tasks such as machine translation, alignment, and representation learning;
- **Public-facing web platform**, providing accessible translation tools while promoting Dongxiang language and cultural awareness;
- **Extensible and research-friendly project structure**, allowing seamless integration of new data, models, and evaluation strategies.
